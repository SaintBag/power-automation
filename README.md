# Power BI Data Model Automation

This project automates the preparation of analytical data models
for Power BI based on a MySQL source schema.

Key capabilities:
- identification of fact and dimension tables
- explicit grain definition
- relationship modeling
- SQL generation for Power BI
- automated validation via CI/CD

The project is built using deterministic artifacts
and version-controlled LLM prompts.
